# Overview

`kernel-sidecar` provides the building blocks for creating applications that run alongside Jupyter Kernels, keeping the Notebook document model in memory and acting as a middle-man between the Kernel and all other clients. There are many potential features that can be built into a Sidecar application:

 - __Persisting Outputs__ for cell execution even when no clients are connected (e.g. run a cell, close your browser, come back later and see the output)
 - __Code Cell Linting__ such as `black` or `isort`
 - __Variable Explorer__ that can be sent to newly connected clients without needing to execute code in the Kernel
 - __Custom Execution Managers__ to handle DAG/dependent cell execution or to dequeue queued cells without sending an interrupt to the Kernel which dequeues all queued cells


## Installation

```bash
pip install kernel-sidecar
```


# Key Concepts

![Architecture overview diagram](docs/overview_arch_diagram.png)

## KernelSidecarClient

The `KernelSidecarClient` class manages the ZMQ connections to the Kernel, sending execute request or other messages to the Kernel, and processing messages coming back from the Kernel on `iopub`, `shell`, `control`, and `stdin` channels. All messages sent and received are modeled with Pydantic. When preparing to send a request to the Kernel, it's structured as a `KernelAction` which connects the request with zero-to-many callbacks for responses to that specific request.


## KernelAction

`KernelAction` connects three key pieces of the request-reply flow between the sidecar application and the Kernel:
 - Store the sent Request message
 - Delegate messages to callbacks based on the request message
 - Make the flow "awaitable" based on the Request type, e.g. an `execute_request` is done when `execute_reply` or `error` is received and `status` has gone to `idle`.

## Handlers

When the `KernelSidecarClient` receives a message over ZMQ, parses it into a Pydantic model, and delegates it to the appropriate `Action` to be handled, it passes on that message to every `Handler` attached to the `Action` and awaits all of them to handle that message. `Handler` objects can define handling different message types by creating methods named for the message type, e.g. `async def handle_display_data`. See `handlers.DebugHandler` or `cli.OutputHandler` for examples of custom Handlers.

## Comms

Comms are a flexible way for a client and the Kernel to send messages outside of the `execute_request` format. The most widely used package that utilizes Comms is probably `ipywidgets`, but Comms in general are a very powerful tool for a Sidecar application. A Comm can be opened by either the Sidecar or the Kernel. A target for that Comm should be registered on the other side before the open happens. It's probably most typical to register a Comm target in the Kernel by sending an `execute_request`, then sending a `comm_open` from the Sidecar side. See `tests/test_comms.py` for examples.

Once a Comm is open, it has a unique `comm_id`. `KernelSidecarClient` will automatically route all `comm_msg` messages to a `CommHandler` instance by `comm_id` in the `comm_msg` content. That routing pattern is a bit confusing as it overlaps the `Handler` / `Action` pattern, but it's necessary because `comm_msg` can come in as a result of `execute_request`'s or `comm_msg`'s or potentially other messages. So the `CommManager` -> `CommHandler` routing basically needs to be applied to every message the `KernelSidecarClient` receives over ZMQ.


## Models

`kernel-sidecar` has Pydantic models for:
 - The Jupyter Notebook document (`models/notebook.py`), which should be consistent with `nbformat` parsing / structure
 - Request messages sent to the Kernel over ZMQ (`models/requests.py`)
 - Messages received over ZMQ from the Kernel (`models/messages.py`)


## CLI

`kernel-sidecar` ships a small CLI for testing a connection to a Kernel.

```bash
‚ùØ sidecar --help
Usage: sidecar [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f FILE                         Kernel connection file  [required]
  --debug / --no-debug            Turn on DEBUG logging  [default: no-debug]
  --execute TEXT                  Execute code string instead of sending
                                  kernel info request
  --tail / --no-tail              Continue tailing ZMQ after connecting or
                                  executing code  [default: no-tail]
  --install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Install completion for the specified shell.
  --show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Show completion for the specified shell, to
                                  copy it or customize the installation.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

Try it out by starting an IPython kernel in one terminal and using the CLI in another.

```bash
python -m ipykernel_launcher --debug -f /tmp/kernel.json
```
